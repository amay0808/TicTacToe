# Tic-Tac-Toe Terminal Game

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game! This is a simple terminal-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, designed as a beginner Python project. It allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other in the terminal.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe directly in your terminal.
- Simple and intuitive text-based interface.
- Supports two players on the same machine.

## Prerequisites

To play this game, you'll need:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.

## How to Play

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git, or download the ZIP file and extract it.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amay0808/TicTacToe.git
   cd TicTacToe
   ```

Run the game using Python from the terminal:

python3 TicTacToe.py

Gameplay Instructions

The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, numbered 1 through 9.
Player 1 uses 'X', and Player 2 uses 'O'.
Players take turns entering the number of the spot where they wish to place their marker.
The first player to get 3 of their markers in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins.
If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game is declared a tie.
Exiting the Game

You can exit the game anytime by typing q when prompted to choose a position.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by and based on knowledge gained from the [Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6CCdCBVypg) by CDcodes on YouTube. I have made several modifications to the original concepts presented to fit the specific requirements of this version of the game. A huge thanks to CDcodes for providing such an informative and easy-to-follow tutorial.
